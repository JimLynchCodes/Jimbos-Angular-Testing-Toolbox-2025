# Why Write Tests?

Throughout my career, I have found it _extremely useful_, and as your codebase scales up- _necessarry_, to have automated tests.

When deploying code, it is imperitive that it works. But not just that it works- that you ___know___ that it works.

When you are a junior or mid level engineer you are not expected to have well tested code.

Even for many senior engineers, the high level of discipline is not always there.

The business gets axious, people cut corners, arbitraty deadlines approach...

But now, I am in somewhat of a leadership position on a new team.

I'm inheriting an Angular project that already has high profile clients using it in production.

It's my job to take owership of this platform, building it back up from a legacy codebase to one we can all happily open up and enjoy together like it's a warm bublling hot tub. 

I need to lead by example, and show others the way to deploying with confidence, and my secret weapon is having a strong suite of tests.
